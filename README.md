Don't miss a MS Team Notification with this extension.

It is useful to display notification badges on ms teams icons in the task bar when you are using a [web application version](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/install-manage-or-uninstall-apps-in-microsoft-edge-0c156575-a94a-45e4-a54f-3a84846f6113) of MS Teams. It shows the number of unread notifications in the badges which is refreshed in real time.

Unread badge notifications stay in the taskbar even if you close you browser.
